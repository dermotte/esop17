# ESOP Wintersemester 2017/18
Demo and tutorial code for the programming course (ESOP) at Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt.

## Organization
You will find the source code organized in packages at.aau.itec.esop17.lesson*XX*, whereas _XX_ gives the running lecture number. Note, that files most likely have a history, which means that in the course a way was tried, then edited, then edited again, etc. I try to conserve them with commits, so take a look at the *history* of the files. 

## How to use
The most basic use is to use the button to the lower right *Download ZIP*. You can then use any editor or IDE to open the files. IDEA for instance allows for importing the project using the _gradle.build_ file. Another way is to simply clone them from the repository. There is extensive help on that for command line and Github Desktop at https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/. However, you can download git from http://git-scm.com/, tell the IDEA IDE where to find it and use from within the IDE. *Pulling* allows to update your local copy at any time. If you find an error in my code, don't hesitate to *fork* the repository, *fix* the bug and send me a *pull request* to add your bugfix. 

Github has an extensive help database, so you might find a lot of answers there. There's also a lot of information out there on how to use git, so just dare to Google for answers.
